# Corporate Services Assistant (proof of concept)

A bilingual Arabic and English AI assistant concept for HR, finance, procurement and IT services in a government authority, built as a pre-sales case study.

## Things to try

- Pick a persona on the sign-in screen. Each one has different permissions, so the answers and documents change.
- Ask a policy question in English or Arabic, then open a citation to see the source next to its other-language version.
- Raise an IT request and approve it. Nothing is submitted until you press Submit.
- In the Trust centre, run the red-team suite and the release gate.
- Press Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on a Mac) to jump anywhere or ask a question.

## Good to know

- Everything runs in your browser. There's no server, nothing you type is sent anywhere, and the data resets when you reload.
- Answers come from a deterministic, rule-based engine, not a language model. The production design uses Azure OpenAI in the UAE North region.
- All organisations, people, documents and figures are fictional. This is not an official government service.
- Because the whole demo is one page, the sample documents are readable in the page source. Permission filtering is demonstrated here; a production build enforces it on the server.
